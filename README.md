Overview of the Project 

Project Exploratory Python programming on Student Grade Tracker
Overview of Student Grade Tracker:
The Student Grade Tracker is a Python-based application designed to track student performance by collecting grades for various subjects or assignments. Its main objective is to automate the grade calculation process, provide accurate average grades, and display the studentâ€™s CGPA .
OBJECTIVES:
1.Streamline the entry of student grades.
2.Calculate the average and CGPA.
3.Convert numeric grades into letter grades.
4.Provide a clear, organized summary of a student's performance.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
1.Successfully implements numeric to letter grade conversion.
2.Ensures input validation to handle invalid entries (e.g., out-of-range or non-numeric values).
3.Calculates average grade and CGPA with real-time data entry for multiple subjects.

TECHNOLGIES USED:
1.Python for core functionality, logic, and input handling.
2.Built-in error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness.

CONCLUSION : This project simplifies the grading process and provides students with a comprehensive overview of their performance. It highlights how basic programming principles can create functional tools for academic record-keeping.
